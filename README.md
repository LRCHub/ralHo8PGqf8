[00:03.19] 'Cause I've been living life right like I could just die any minute
[00:07.33] Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit
[00:11.10] I don't need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
[00:15.36] Are you alive or just breathing?
[00:31.36] 
[00:19.39] 'Cause I've been living life right like I could just die any minute
[00:23.27] Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit
[00:27.29] I don't need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
[00:31.24] Are you alive or just breathing?
[00:47.24] 
[00:36.20] Flashing red lights, driving at night
[00:38.21] Windowless ride, feeling alive
[00:40.19] Nothing insight, forever in flight
[00:42.01] Follow those lines, we'll make it this time
[00:44.12] Blurry street lights, work as a guide
[00:46.20] To memories that we're making tonight
[00:48.93] Oh yeah, we're making tonight, yeah
[01:06.43] 
[00:52.05] I'll do anything that I feel like I wanna do
[00:56.50] I'm living life like I got nothing left to prove
[01:00.52] No end in sight, just always staying on the move
[01:04.42] I'll go all night if that's just what I gotta do
[01:28.42] 
[01:07.85] Life's too short
[01:10.73] To care about what you can't afford
[01:14.07] Memories are in what you explore
[01:18.60] So just don't be ignored, go ask for more, go ask for more
[01:47.60] 
[01:23.29] 'Cause I've been living life right like I could just die any minute
[01:27.25] Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit
[01:31.28] I don't need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
[01:35.29] Are you alive or just breathing?
[01:51.29] 
[01:39.15] 'Cause I've been living life right like I could just die any minute
[01:43.34] Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit
[01:47.34] I don't need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
[01:51.54] Are you alive or just breathing?
[02:07.54] 
[01:55.54] I'm in a race that everybody's chasing fast
[01:57.58] They wanna be that someone on the screen at last
[01:59.74] They ain't looking inside for their needs in life
[02:01.51] They wanna be liked by everybody insight
[02:03.67] But trust me being free ain't spotlights
[02:05.52] No, it's long nights
[02:06.62] And it's long fights
[02:07.64] With yourself all the time to get your mind right
[02:09.56] But if you put in the work you can find the light alright?
[02:38.56] 
[02:11.87] I'll do anything that I feel like I wanna do
[02:16.59] I'm living life like I got nothing left to prove
[02:20.58] No end in sight, just always staying on the move
[02:24.52] I'll go all night if that's just what I gotta do
[02:48.52] 
[02:27.62] Life's too short
[02:30.38] To care about what you can't afford
[02:34.58] Memories are in what you explore
[02:38.50] So just don't be ignored, go ask for more, go ask for more
[03:07.50] 
[02:46.90] 'Cause I've been living life right like I could just die any minute
[02:51.06] Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit
[02:54.93] I don't need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
[02:59.26] Are you alive or just breathing?
[03:15.26] 
[03:03.12] 'Cause I've been living life right like I could just die any minute
[03:07.05] Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit
[03:11.05] I don't need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
[03:15.18] Are you alive or just breathing?
